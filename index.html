      <p id="hidden-f">You may want to consider Front-End Development, where the user interaction with a product is paramount.  If you choose Front-End, you will be working with HTML, CSS, and Javascript, as well as helpful Front-End frameworks, which are constantly changing and improving.</p>
      <p id="hidden-b">You may want to consider Back-End Development, where the business logic systems are built.  For Back-End, you may want to continue the survey to see which programming languages may be a good fit for you to start with.</p>
      <p id="hidden-s">You may want to consider becoming a Full-Stack Developer, who learns both the Back-End--where the business logic systems are built--and Front-End--where the user interaction with a product is paramount.  Many developers start out in one or the other and expand their knowledge in their career.  For Front-End, you will be working with HTML, CSS, and Javascript, as well as helpful Front-End frameworks, which are constantly changing and improving.  For Back-End, you may want to continue the survey to see which programming languages may be a good fit for you to start with.</p>

      <!-- hidden answer. -->
      <div class="lang-answer">

        <p>You may want to consider the following language<span id="plural">s</span>:</p>
        <!-- make this an unordered list -->
        <p id="c">C#</p>
        <p id="java">Java</p>
        <p id="php">PHP</p>
        <p id="ruby">Ruby</p>
        <!-- change language, borrowed from epicodus page -->
        <p>However, even though each language has its niche, there is plenty of crossover. For example, Rails' popularity inspired copycats in just about every language, and so you'll see interactive web applications written in C#, Java, and PHP, with Rails-like frameworks including .NET MVC, Spring, and Laravel. Even at one company, you might find them using PHP for their marketing site, Ruby for their web application, and Java for their back-end processing. The most important thing is to get the basic principles of coding down, practice a lot, and be ready to change to another language when your job inevitably does.</p>
