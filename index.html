              <p>Since it has been around for so long, some of the biggest organizations in the world are built using the language. Many banks, retailers, insurance companies, utilities, and manufacturers all use Java.  Java is still a relevant programming language that shows no sign of declining in popularity and, for that reason, is worth learning. Many developers pick it up as their first programming language because it’s reasonably easy to learn.</p>

        <p>Choosing your first programming language isn't as important as you might think.  Once you learn programming it will be much easier to pick up additional languages, and it may even be expected of you.  Research what types of things you want to do, and find out what languages they use.  Perhaps try out other languages while you are learning your first so you can be comfortable switching between them.</p>
